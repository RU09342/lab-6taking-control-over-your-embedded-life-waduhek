# Lab 6: Taking Control Over your Embedded Life
This lab explores the use of relays and MOSFETs to allow the MSP430 to safely interact with higher power devices such as a fan. The second part of this lab explorers using a MOSFET to PWM a fan creating a cooling effect proportional to the fan duty cycle. This system uses an open loop system. An open loop system is one which adjusts an output based on a correlation to an input. This correlation is often determined through testing and creating a model which is then followed without any feedback from the true system. This style of system does not take into account environmental factors which could change from test to test. More information can be found on the readme files in the other folders.
