# Lab 6: Taking Control Over your Embedded Life
This lab explores the use of relays and MOSFETs to allow the MSP430 to safely interact with higher power devices such as a fan. The second part of this lab explorers using a MOSFET to PWM a fan creating a cooling effect proportional to the fan duty cycle.
