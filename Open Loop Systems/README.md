# Lab 6: Open Loop Systems
An open loop system is one which does not take feedback into consideration. For this part of the lab we will design a system which will change the temperature of a voltage regulator to the temperature of a setpoint which is sent over UART to the MSP430. This setpoint is then used in an equation derived from measurements taken which correlate the temperature that the fan will cool to and the PWM setting of the fan. In our case this equation was not very linear so to make it linear the data was split into two different lines. The two equations are pwm = -3138.9*tp + 1377.8 and pwm = -220.56*tp + 163.16.
Based on the setpoint temperature the program will decided which equation to utilize and use this information to create a PWM signal. This PWM signal is then used to control the voltage which is connected to the fan. To do this the PWM signal is fed to the gate of a MOSFET and the MOSFET switches on and off very rapidly. In creating this system we created a low side switch as the n-type MOSFET was placed between the ground cable of the fan and ground.
The data collected on the Temperature vs PWM can be seen in the excel file in this repository.
